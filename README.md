# Pandas Descriptive Statistics with imported notebook from Colab

This project is to demonstrate how to create a visualization on CSV input files. We then bake in CICD functionality to profile our dataset at CICD runtime.

## Project Function
- Read the "VCT'21 Map Ban Dataset"
- Create a visualization , depicting the distribution of the banned maps.
- Profile the dataset as a CICD process (output as report.md).
